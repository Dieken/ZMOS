# ZMOS - A small desktop operating system

Regards to Zilog Z80 and MOS 6502, experiment to see how usable a
FreeBSD based desktop operating system could be with some suckless
software.

## Philosophy and Principle

* No live CD, no OS installer, just a simple shell script to install required software
* As less system level customization as possible, the DE experience is limited to single user
* Balance between usability and disk & memory size, pick as suckless software as possible
