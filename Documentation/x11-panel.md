# Panel for X window

## Functions provided by a panel

* menu
* launcher(shortcut)
* workspace list
* task/window list
* system tray: date & time, battery, volume, brightness, language, wireless, cpu/mem/disk/net/load
* current user, logout/shutdown/reboot/hibernate/suspend
* notification(??)

## Candidates

* i3bar + i3blocks: support click, all information are from external shell script
* i3bar + i3status: i3status is mainly for Linux, doesn't support memory information for FreeBSD.
* fbpanel: doesn't work in i3 and awesome
* polybar: mainly for Linux, doesn't work well on FreeBSD
* tint2: too many options :-P
